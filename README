OVERVIEW
========
mustache.tcl is a Tcl-only implementation of the mustache templating language. 

This package supports the v1.1.2 mustache spec which can be found at 
https://github.com/mustache/spec/tree/master/specs, lambdas are supported, too.

See https://github.com/mustache for further information on mustache.


INVOCATION
==========
There is only a single command

	::mustache::mustache template data

which takes a template and a data dict and returns the rendered text.

	set text {
		<h1>Dear {{firstname}},{{! This is a comment}}</h1>
		<p>Best wishes to your {{age}} birthday.</p>
		<h2>{{sender}}</h2>
	}
	set data [dict create firstname "Fred" age "40th" sender "Greg & Tina"]

	puts [::mustache::mustache $text $data]

Partials are supplied from variables in the current scope.
The lambda prefix can be changed globally, should this ever be needed, by
doing

	set ::mustache::LambdaPrefix "Λtcl"

See examples.tcl.


TESTSUITE
=========
The package passes all the mandatory tests from the testsuite without
modifications. You can update the yaml files in the tests directory to
check against a newer version of the mustache spec. Call

	tests.tcl

to run the testsuite. A single argument denoting the test number to run
is also supported

Lambdas
-------
The ~lambdas.yml file from the spec had to be tweaked, as there hadn't
been any Tcl lambdas in there. Second, Tcl doesn't support explicit
typing, so tcllib's yaml suite doesn't support the !code modifier. Instead
a lambda has to be marked with Λtcl (that's an uppercase lambda in front of
the "tcl"), which acts as a magic string making mustache.tcl detecting a
lambda.


BUGS
====
Partials indentation still seems to be hairy, though the test suite isn't
affected. We need more testcases! If you are using mustache for e.g. HTML
templates and you aren't fussy about pretty-printing, this shouldn't bother
you.

If you found another bug or have more testcases, please contact me.
