  Additional testcases for mustache.tcl lambda unsafe sections.

  Unsafe sections are ordinary sections which start with the unsafe marker.
  This is without side effects for key/value-list-type sections.

  These sections are required because Tcl doesn't support explicit typing.
  Without them Tcl injection (as in "SQL injection") could take place from
  unchecked user content. To avoid the headache coming from checking all the
  user content for illegal input, lambdas can be selectively disabled within
  a section.

  Selectively means lambdas aren't completely disabled. What is disabled is
  their interpolation from the user supplied section context. Instead, the
  innermost value from the context outside the unsafe section is substituted.
  Which may be a lambda itself - a safe one, not taken from user input. This
  makes it possible to safely use programmer defined lambdas deep inside an
  "unsafe" section. Content not detected as a lambda isn't affected.

  The basic idea is to wrap the whole template into such an "unsafe" section
  and define the needed lambdas outside. Or with finer sectioning, at the
  programmers choice.
tests:
  - name: Values - Limited
    desc: Lambdas inside unsafe section should be replaced by safe values.
    data:
      userdata: 'Sure I am'
      name: 'sleepyhead'
      unsafe:
        λtcl: false
        userdata: 'Λtcl {return "I do evil things"}'
        name: 'mindful programmer'
    template: "Are you nice? - {{#unsafe}}{{userdata}}, {{name}}{{/unsafe}}!"
    expected: "Are you nice? - Sure I am, mindful programmer!"

  - name: Section - Limited
    desc: Lambda section inside unsafe section should be replaced by a safe values.
    data:
      safelambda: 'Λtcl {expr [join $arg *]}'
      unsafe: 
        λtcl: false
        userdata: 'Λtcl {return "I do evil things with your $arg"}'
    template: "6! == {{#unsafe}}{{#userdata}}1 2 3 4 5 6{{/userdata}}{{#safelambda}}1 2 3 4 5 6{{/safelambda}}{{/unsafe}}"
    expected: "6! == 720"
